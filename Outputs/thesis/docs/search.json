    "text": "Benefits\nThe benefits of using Quarto document include:\n\nIt allows you to write your thesis in a simple markup language called Markdown. This means that you can focus on writing your thesis without having to worry about formatting.\nThe document can be output to a variety of formats including PDF, HTML, Word, and LaTeX.\nCode can be easily embedded in the document and executed. This means that you can include the results of your analysis in your thesis without having to manually copy and paste them. This is a good reproducible and scientific practice.\nYou can easily integrate with aspects of GitHub (edit, reporting an issue, etc).\n\nThe above outlined benefits can also be considered as best practice. Version controlling and collaborative writing (via Git and GitHub) are important in managing multiple versions of your thesis and in collaborating with your supervisory team. Embedding code in your thesis is a good practice in reproducible research. Making your thesis in HTML format can allow for interactive web elements to be embedded while PDF format can be for general distribution and printing.",

Unfortunately, there is no equivalent system with track changes in Quarto. You can output the tex file from Quarto document and use this in Overleaf. The changes made in this tex document however has to be manually transferred back to the Quarto document. If your main output is mainly mathematical and you have little to no code outputs, Overleaf is probably a better choice.",

    "text": "(Summary)\nFactor analysis model is a mathematical model which tries to use fewer underlying factors to explain the correlation between a large set of observed variables(Mardia et al.,1995). Suppose we have a p-dimensional random vector \\(y\\in \\mathbf{R^p}\\) with mean \\(E[y]=\\mu\\) and variance \\(Var[y]=\\Sigma\\). We can establish a d-order factor analysis model for \\(y\\) if it can be written in the form \\[y=\\Lambda u+\\mu+\\epsilon\\], where \\(\\Lambda \\in \\mathbf{R}^{p \\times d}\\) is called , we call \\(u \\in \\mathbf{R}^{d}\\) as and \\(\\epsilon \\in \\mathbf{R}^{p}\\) is . To make the model well-defined, we may assume \\[E[u]=\\mathbf{0}, Var[u]=\\mathbf{I}, E[\\epsilon]=\\mathbf{0} \\text{ and covariance } Var[\\epsilon]=\\Psi=\\text{diag}(\\psi_{11},\\dots,\\psi_{pp})\\] and also \\[Cov[u,\\epsilon]=\\mathbf{0}\\] thus this model implies a straightforward constraint \\[Var[y]=\\Lambda\\Lambda^T+\\Psi\\]\nA two-step procedure is used to establish an interpretable model: First is to estimate parameters, i.e.\\(\\Lambda\\) and \\(\\Psi\\) in the model sparsely, and then utilize rotation techniques to make the model easy to understand(Hirose, 2015). Traditionally, sparsity can be achieved via LASSO penalty of the likelihood function theoretically but in fact, it may produce biased and overdense models(Hirose,2015). Further, penalization methods using some nonconvex penalties give a more sparse one than LASSO, such as the SCAD(Fan and Li, 2001), the MC+(Zhang, 2010) and the EM algorithm with coordinate descent(Hirose, 2015).\nIn a generalized linear latent variable model(GLLVM), just like what we do in a generalized linear model(GLM), we use the link function and add a linear term to fit the mean of \\(y\\). Specifically, if we have a set of \\(n\\) observed data \\({x_i,y_i}:i=1,2,...n, y_i\\in \\mathbf{R^p} \\text{ and } x_i\\in \\mathbf{R^q}\\), where any elements in \\(y_i\\), say \\(y_{ij}\\) are independently observed from the exponential family of distributions with mean \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) and dispersion \\(\\psi_{ij}\\), i.e. \\[y_{ij}\\sim \\text{ IID } f(y_{ij};\\theta_{ij},\\psi_{ij})=\\exp\\{\\frac{y_{ij}\\theta_{ij}-b(\\theta_{ij})}{\\psi_{ij}}+c(y_{ij},\\psi_{ij})\\}\\] Then the GLLVM of \\(y_{ij}\\) can be given as \\[\\eta_{ij}:=g(E[y_{ij}])=g(\\mu_{ij})=x_i^T\\beta_j+u_i^T\\lambda_j+\\epsilon_{ij},\\] (Hui et al., 2018)where \\(g(.)\\) is the link, \\(x_i^T\\beta_j\\) is the linear term with \\(q\\) predictors, \\(u_i^T\\lambda_j\\) is the latent term with \\(d\\) latent variables, \\(\\epsilon_i=(\\epsilon_{i1},...,\\epsilon_{ip})\\sim N(\\mathbf{0},\\Psi)\\). We assume the latent variables come from a d-dimensional multivariate standard normal distribution, \\(u_i \\sim N(\\mathbf{0},I_d)\\). Just like in the factor analysis model, the conditional variance of \\(\\eta_i\\) is given by \\(Var[\\eta_i|x_i]=\\Lambda\\Lambda^T+\\Psi\\)",
