# Method {#sec-method}

As described in @sec-bg, there are various methods to fit a factor analytic model to multivariate data. There are several 

## Existing R packages

## Selecting initial values 

- MLE approach (non-penalised approach)
- MLE + Rotation
- FA model -> one order at a time
- uniform/fixed 


## Simulation setting 

Criteria? Judge based on estimation? Sparsity structure.


### Setting 1

- Hirose + other existing simulation settings in published papers
- Different FA order (k = 2, 4, 6, 8 x n = 200, 400, 800, 1600 x sparse vs non-sparse).



### Setting 2
