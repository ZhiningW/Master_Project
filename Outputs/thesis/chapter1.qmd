# What is factor analysis and why is it important?

Factor analysis is a mathematical model which tries to use fewer
underlying factors to explain the correlation between a large set of
observed variables[@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]. It provides a useful tool for
exploring the covariance structure among observable variables [@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. One of the major assumptions that factor analytic model stands on
is that it is impossible for us to observe those underlying factors
directly. This assumption is especially suited to subjects like
psychology where we cannot observe exactly some concept like how
intelligent our subjects are[@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979].

Suppose we have a observable random vector $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^p$
with mean $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{y}]=\mu$ and variance
$\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=\Sigma$. Then a d-order factor analysis model
for $\mathbf{y}$ can be given by \begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}=\Lambda \mathbf{f}+\mu+\epsilon,
\end{equation} where $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times d}$ is called
\emph{loading matrix}, we call $\mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ as
\emph{common vectors} and $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is
\emph{unique factors}. To make the model well-defined, we may assume
$$\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{f}]=\mathbf{0}_d, \mathbb{V}[\mathbf{f}]=\mathbf{I}_{d\times d}, \mathbb{E}[\epsilon]=\mathbf{0}_p, \mathbb{V}[\epsilon]=:\Psi=\text{diag}(\psi_{11},\dots,\psi_{pp})$$
and also the independence between any elements from $\mathbf{f}$ and
$\epsilon$ separately, i.e.
$$\mathbf{Cov}[\mathbf{f}_i,\epsilon_j]=0, \text{for all } i\in\{1,2,\dots,d\} \text{ and } j \in \{1,2,\dots,p\}$$
Straightforwardly, the covariance of observable vector $\mathbf{y}$ can
be modelled by\
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi
\end{equation}

# Indeterminacy of the loading matrix

One can easily see that if our factor analytic model is given by (1),
then it can also be modelled as
$$\mathbf{y}=(\Lambda\mathbf{M})(\mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{f}) +\mu+\epsilon$$
where the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is orthogonal and simultaneously the
variance of $\mathbf{y}$ given by (2) still holds, since
$$\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=(\Lambda\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^\top)\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{f}](\Lambda\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^\top)^\top+\Psi=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi.$$
Therefore a rotated loading matrix $\Lambda\mathbf{M}$ is still a valid
loading matrix for a factor analytic model. Sometimes we resolve this problem by making the loading matrix to satisfy some constraints like [@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]
$$\Lambda^\top \Psi^{-1} \Lambda \text{ is diagonal.}$$

# Traditional Estimation of Parameters in Factor Analytic Models 
We denote the set of parameters by $\beta := \{\text{vec}(\Lambda),\text{vec}(\Psi)\}$ where $\text{vec}(\cdot)$ is the vectorisation of the input.
Traditionally, a two-step procedure is used to construct a factor
analytic model: estimate parameters by maximum likelihood estimation
(aka, MLE) and then use rotation techniques to find an interpretable
model.  

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
Suppose we have $N$ independent and identically distributed observations
$\mathbf{y}_1,\mathbf{y}_2,\dots,\mathbf{y}_N$ from a p-dimensional
multi-variate normal distribution $N_p(\mu,\Sigma)$ and by our
hypothesis, we have $\Sigma=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi$. Then the likelihood
function is given by
$$L(\Lambda,\Psi)=\prod^N_{i=1}\left[(2\pi)^{-\frac{p}{2}}\det(\Sigma)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)^\top\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu))\right].$$
and hence the log-likelihood is given by
\begin{align*}
l(\Lambda,\Psi)=& \sum^N_{i=2}[-\frac{p}{2}\log(2\pi)-\frac{1}{2}\log(\det(\Sigma))-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)^\top\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)]\\
&= -\frac{N}{2}[p\log(2\pi)+\log(\det(\Sigma))+\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}S)].
\end{align*}
To get the MLE of parameters, we seek the roots of equation system
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \Lambda}l(\Lambda,\Psi)=0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \Psi}l(\Lambda,\Psi)=0.
\end{cases}
However, there is no closed form of the roots. Many iterative algorithms are developed to get the roots of the equation, like EM algorithm developed by Rubin[@Rubin1982EMAlgorithms]. 


## Rotation techniques
After estimation, we want to rotate the loading matrix to possess a sparse matrix in order to interpret the observable variables by underlying factors better. Also there are many method to achieve rotation as well such as the varimax method and the promax method [@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015].

Suppose $Q(\Lambda)$ is an criterion for $\Lambda$ in the rotation procedure, and we may express it as $Q(\Lambda):= \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^d_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})$ where $P(\cdot)$ is some loss function[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. Specifically, if we set $P(\cdot)=|\cdot|$, we have LASSO to generate a theoretically sparse loading matrix. If we rewrite this in a optimization problem, it can be given as [@Jennrich2004Rotation]
\begin{align*}
&\min_\Lambda \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^d_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})\\
&\text{subject to } \Lambda=\Lambda_0\mathbf{M} \text{ and } \mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{I}_d,
\end{align*}
where $\Lambda_0$ is an initial guess. Since we execute this technique after obtaining the MLE of parameters, therefore what we want is 
\begin{align*}
&\min_\Lambda \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^d_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})\\
&\text{subject to } \Lambda=\hat{\Lambda}_{\text{MLE}}\mathbf{M} \text{ and } \mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{I}_d,
\end{align*}
where $\hat{\Lambda}_{\text{MLE}}$ is the maximum likelihood estimator.

## Discussion about two-step method
The traditional two-step method faces significant shortcomings, primarily its unsuitability[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. Similar to challenges in regression models, MLE can result in overfitting, and rotation techniques might not yield a sufficiently sparse loading matrix. 

I am considering if a simulation study is needed for a clearer view.

The absence of model selection complicates efficient modeling by making it difficult to determine the precise number of underlying factors, that is, the order of the factor analytic model. A usual but troublesome method is conducting a hypothesis test for the model[@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]. We have
\begin{align*}
  &&&H_k: k \text{ common factors are sufficient to describe the data } \\
  \longleftrightarrow &&&H_a: \text{ Otherwise}.
\end{align*}
The test statistics is given by $\text{TS}=nF(\hat{\Lambda},\hat{\Psi})$ which has an asymptotic $\chi^2_s$ distribution with $s=\frac{1}{2}(p-d)^2-(p+d)$ by the property of MLE. Typically, the test is conducted at a $5\%$ significant level. We can start the procedure from a very small $k$, say, $k=1$ or $k=2$ and then increase $k$ until the null hypothesis is not rejected.



# Penalized Likelihood Method
Our research later will focus on penalized likelihood method such like LASSO penalty[@ning2011sparsefactoranalysisl1regularization] [@choi2010penalizedmaximumlikelihoodapproach] and may include some non-convex penalty like MC+[@zhang2010variableselectionminimaxconcave].
