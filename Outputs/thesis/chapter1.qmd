# Introduction

## What is factor analysis and why is it important?

Factor analysis is a mathematical model which tries to use fewer
underlying factors to explain the correlation between a large set of
observed variables [@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]. It provides a useful tool for
exploring the covariance structure among observable variables [@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. One of the major assumptions that factor analytic model stands on
is that it is impossible for us to observe those underlying factors
directly. This assumption is especially suited to subjects like
psychology where we cannot observe exactly some concept like how
intelligent our subjects are [@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979].

Suppose we have a observable random vector $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^p$
with mean $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{y}]=\mu$ and variance
$\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=\Sigma$. Then a $k$-order factor analysis model
for $\mathbf{y}$ can be given by \begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}=\Lambda \mathbf{f}+\mu+\epsilon,
\end{equation} where $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times k}$ is called
_loading matrix_, we call $\mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ as
_common factors_ and $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is
_unique factors_. To make the model well-defined, we may assume
$$\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{f}]=\mathbf{0}_k, \mathbb{V}[\mathbf{f}]=\mathbf{I}_{k\times k}, \mathbb{E}[\epsilon]=\mathbf{0}_p, \mathbb{V}[\epsilon]=:\Psi=\text{diag}(\psi_{11},\dots,\psi_{pp})$$
and also the independence between any elements from $\mathbf{f}$ and
$\epsilon$ separately, i.e.
$$Cov[\mathbf{f}_i,\epsilon_j]=0, \text{for all } i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\} \text{ and } j \in \{1,2,\dots,p\}$$
Straightforwardly, the covariance of observable vector $\mathbf{y}$ can
be modelled by\
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi
\end{equation}
If we assemble the $n$ observation, $\{\mathbf{y}_1,\mathbf{y}_2,\dots,\mathbf{y}_n\}$, into a matrix $\mathbf{Y}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$. The model can be rewritten as 
$$\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{F}\Lambda^\top+\mu+\epsilon$$ where common factors matrix $\mathbf{F}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$.

# Indeterminacy of the loading matrix

One can easily see that if our factor analytic model is given by (1),
then it can also be modelled as
$$\mathbf{y}=(\Lambda\mathbf{M})(\mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{f}) +\mu+\epsilon$$
where the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is orthogonal and simultaneously the
variance of $\mathbf{y}$ given by (2) still holds, since
$$\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{y}]=(\Lambda\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^\top)\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{f}](\Lambda\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^\top)^\top+\Psi=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi.$$
Therefore a rotated loading matrix $\Lambda\mathbf{M}$ is still a valid
loading matrix for a factor analytic model. Sometimes we resolve this problem by making the loading matrix to satisfy some constraints like [@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]
$$\Lambda^\top \Psi^{-1} \Lambda \text{ is diagonal.}$$

# Traditional Estimation of Parameters in Factor Analytic Models 
We denote the set of parameters by $\beta := \{\text{vec}(\Lambda),\text{vec}(\Psi)\}$ where $\text{vec}(\cdot)$ is the vectorisation of the input.
Traditionally, a two-step procedure is used to construct a factor
analytic model: estimate parameters by maximum likelihood estimation
(aka, MLE) and then use rotation techniques to find an interpretable
model.  

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
Suppose we have $n$ independent and identically distributed observations
$\mathbf{y}_1,\mathbf{y}_2,\dots,\mathbf{y}_N$ from a p-dimensional
multi-variate normal distribution $N_p(\mu,\Sigma)$ and by our
hypothesis, we have $\Sigma=\Lambda\Lambda^\top+\Psi$. Then the likelihood
function is given by
$$L(\Lambda,\Psi)=\prod^n_{i=1}\left[(2\pi)^{-\frac{p}{2}}\det(\Sigma)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)^\top\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu))\right].$$
and hence the log-likelihood is given by
\begin{align*}
l(\Lambda,\Psi)=& \sum^n_{i=1}[-\frac{p}{2}\log(2\pi)-\frac{1}{2}\log(\det(\Sigma))-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)^\top\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)]\\
&= -\frac{n}{2}[p\log(2\pi)+\log(\det(\Sigma))+\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}S)],
\end{align*}
where $S$ is the sample covariance defined as $S:=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)(\mathbf{y}_i-\mu)^\top$. To get the MLE of parameters, we seek the roots of equation system
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \Lambda}l(\Lambda,\Psi)=0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \Psi}l(\Lambda,\Psi)=0.
\end{cases}
However, there is no closed form of the roots. Many iterative algorithms are developed to get the roots of the equation, like EM algorithm developed by Rubin[@Rubin1982EMAlgorithms]. 


## Rotation techniques
After estimation, we want to rotate the loading matrix to possess a sparse matrix in order to interpret the observable variables by underlying factors better. Also there are many method to achieve rotation as well such as the varimax method and the promax method [@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015].

Suppose $Q(\Lambda)$ is an criterion for $\Lambda$ in the rotation procedure, and we may express it as $Q(\Lambda):= \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^d_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})$ where $P(\cdot)$ is some loss function[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. Specifically, if we set $P(\cdot)=|\cdot|$, we have LASSO to generate a theoretically sparse loading matrix. If we rewrite this in a optimization problem, it can be given as [@Jennrich2004Rotation]
\begin{align*}
&\min_\Lambda \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})\\
&\text{subject to } \Lambda=\Lambda_0\mathbf{M} \text{ and } \mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{I}_k,
\end{align*}
where $\Lambda_0$ is an initial guess. Since we execute this technique after obtaining the MLE of parameters, therefore what we want is 
\begin{align*}
&\min_\Lambda \sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}P(\lambda_{ij})\\
&\text{subject to } \Lambda=\hat{\Lambda}_{\text{MLE}}\mathbf{M} \text{ and } \mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{I}_k,
\end{align*}
where $\hat{\Lambda}_{\text{MLE}}$ is the maximum likelihood estimator.

## Discussion about two-step method
The traditional two-step method faces significant shortcomings, primarily its unsuitability[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. Similar to challenges in regression models, MLE can result in overfitting, and rotation techniques might not yield a sufficiently sparse loading matrix. See this as an example: Suppose the true loading matrix is given by
$$
\Lambda=
\begin{bmatrix}
0.8 & 0 \\
0 & 0.8 \\
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
We generate $\mathbf{Y}\in \mathbb{R}^{{100}\times 5}$ using common factor $\mathbf{f}\in \mathbb{R}^{{100}\times 2}$ where each factor is generated randomly from standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$. We utilize the R-function factanal() to produce the loading matrix via MLE and then call varimax() to rotate our loading matrix. What we finally get is
$$
\hat{\Lambda}=
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.158 & 0.985\\
0 & 0\\
0.997 & 0\\
0.207 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix},
$$
which is neither precise nor sparse.

Simulation code:
```
set.seed(123)
n <- 100 # Number of observations
p <- 5   # Number of features

factor1 <- rnorm(n, 0, 1) # set factors
factor2 <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)

X <- matrix(NA, nrow=n, ncol=p)
X[,1] <- 0.8*factor1 + rnorm(n, 0, 1)  # Strong loading
X[,2] <- 0.8*factor2 + rnorm(n, 0, 1)  # Strong loading
X[,3] <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)  # Noise, no strong loading on any factor
X[,4] <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)  
X[,5] <- rnorm(n, 0, 1) 

fa_result <- factanal(factors = 2, covmat = cor(X))
rotated_fa <- varimax(fa_result$loadings)

```




Another problem is that the absence of model selection complicates efficient modeling by making it difficult to determine the precise number of underlying factors, that is, the order of the factor analytic model. A usual but troublesome method is conducting a hypothesis test for the model[@mardiaMultivariateAnalysis1979]. We have
\begin{align*}
  &&&H_k: k \text{ common factors are sufficient to describe the data } \\
  \longleftrightarrow &&&H_a: \text{ Otherwise}.
\end{align*}
The test statistics is given by $\text{TS}=nF(\hat{\Lambda},\hat{\Psi})$ which has an asymptotic $\chi^2_s$ distribution with $s=\frac{1}{2}(p-k)^2-(p+k)$ by the property of MLE. Typically, the test is conducted at a $5\%$ significant level. We can start the procedure from a very small $k$, say, $k=1$ or $k=2$ and then increase $k$ until the null hypothesis is not rejected.



# Penalized Likelihood Method
Penalized likelihood method can be viewed as a generalization of two-step method mentioned above[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. A penalized factor analytic model can be obtained by solving following optimization problem
$$
 \max_{\Lambda,\Psi}l_p := l(\Lambda,\Psi)-\rho\sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}P(|\lambda_{ij}|).
$$
where we call $l_p$ as the penalized likelihood, $\rho$ is called regularization parameter and we can treat $P(\cdot)$ as a penalized function. There are many types of penalized functions developed, such as LASSO ($P(\cdot)=|\cdot|$) and MC+ ($P(|\theta|;\rho;\gamma)=n(|\theta|-\frac{\theta^2}{2\rho\gamma})I(|\theta|<\rho\gamma)+\frac{\rho^2\gamma}{2}I(|\theta|\geq\rho\gamma)$)[@hiroseSparseEstimationNonconcave2015]. In this article, we will mainly focus on the LASSO penalty.

## LASSO penalty and LASSO estimator

Again, recall that the LASSO penalized likelihood is given by
$$l_p=-\frac{n}{2}[p\log(2\pi)+\log(\det(\Sigma))+\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}S)]-\rho\sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}|\lambda_{ij}|$$
and the LASSO estimator, denoted as $(\Lambda^*,\Psi^*)$, can be obtained via
\begin{align*}
(\Lambda^*,\Psi^*) &= \text{arg}\max_{\Lambda,\Psi} \quad -\frac{n}{2}[p\log(2\pi)+\log(\det(\Sigma))+\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}S)]-\rho\sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}|\lambda_{ij}|\\
&=\text{arg}\min_{\Lambda,\Psi} \quad \log(\det(\Sigma))+\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}S)+\frac{2}{n}\rho\sum^p_{i=1}\sum^k_{j=1}|\lambda_{ij}|.
\end{align*}

An E-M algorithm can be applied for evaluating the LASSO estimator.
